# CoInCar-Sim

An Open-Source Simulation Framework  
for Cooperatively Interacting Automobiles

---

# Motivation

* Goal:
  * Tool to develop and evaluate cooperative motion planning
  * Focus: interaction between traffic participants
--

* Problem: 
  * Static datasets are not applicable, participants do not react at all
  * Simple behavior models for simulations do react, but not cooperate
--

* Wanted:
  * A simulation framework where multiple sophisticated agents can interact

---

# Requirements

* Modular

* Fast

* Easy-to-use and open interface

* Tooling
  * Visualization
  * Logging
  * Record and replay
  * Evaluation

---

# Keep it simple

.center[**Don't**]

.center[<img src="architecture_classical.png" alt="Drawing" style="width: 400px;"/>]

* Don't force the use of an underlying physics engine
* Don't focus on sensor and actuator emulation

---

# Keep it simple

.center[**Do**]

.center[<img src="architecture_coincarsim.png" alt="Drawing" style="width: 400px;"/>]

* Only control location and time
* Model physics seperately for every agent, depending on its needs
--

  * Facilitates simultaneous test of sophisticated algorithms using noisy and incomplete information and new approaches using perfect world knowledge

---

# ROS

* http://www.ros.org/

* Large community

* Widely used in automated driving

* Open-source 

* BSD licensed

* Has interfaces in C++ and python

* Actively maintained and developed

* Fulfills all requirements

---

# Interfaces

.center[<img src="architecture_coincarsim.png" alt="Drawing" style="width: 400px;"/>]

* Interface between simulation and software under test
--

  * Facilitates usage of very same code in vehicle and in simulation
--

  * Noise, limited sensing horizon and poor detection / tracking / localization performance can easily be modeled
--

  * Defined as ROS Messages

---

# Getting Started

* Source ROS

* Navigate to the folder where you want to place the framework

* Install
```bash
desired_folder$ bash <(wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/coincar-sim/coincarsim_getting_started/release/setup_workspace.sh)
```

* Run
```bash
desired_folder$ cd catkin_ws
catkin_ws$ source devel/setup.bash
catkin_ws$ roslaunch simulation_initialization_ros_tool _whole_framework.launch
```
